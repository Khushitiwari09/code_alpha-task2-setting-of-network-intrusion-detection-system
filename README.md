# code_alpha-task2-setting-of-network-intrusion-detection-system
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort, implemented on Ubuntu with Kali Linux attack simulations. Detects real-time threats like port scans and exploits through customized rules. Validated in a virtual lab environment, demonstrating effective traffic monitoring and alerting. Provides a foundation for network security hardening
# ðŸ“Œ Objectives
Deploy Snort on Ubuntu as a NIDS to monitor a designated network.

Simulate reconnaissance attacks from Kali Linux using:

Nmap (port scanning, OS fingerprinting)

Evaluate Snortâ€™s detection accuracy by analyzing generated alerts.

Document rules and configurations for reproducibility.
# Part I: Lab Environment Setup
1. Virtual Infrastructure
Attacker Machine: Kali Linux (Offensive Security Tools)

Monitored Machine: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Running Snort IDS)

Network: Host-only/NAT configuration to isolate lab traffic
