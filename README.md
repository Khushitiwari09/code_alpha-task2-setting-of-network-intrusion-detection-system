# code_alpha-task2-setting-of-network-intrusion-detection-system
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort, implemented on Ubuntu with Kali Linux attack simulations. Detects real-time threats like port scans and exploits through customized rules. Validated in a virtual lab environment, demonstrating effective traffic monitoring and alerting. Provides a foundation for network security hardening
# ðŸ“Œ Objectives
Deploy Snort on Ubuntu as a NIDS to monitor a designated network.

Simulate reconnaissance attacks from Kali Linux using:

Nmap (port scanning, OS fingerprinting)

Evaluate Snortâ€™s detection accuracy by analyzing generated alerts.

Document rules and configurations for reproducibility.
# Part I: Lab Environment Setup
1. Virtual Infrastructure
Attacker Machine: Kali Linux (Offensive Security Tools)

Monitored Machine: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Running Snort IDS)

Network: Host-only/NAT configuration to isolate lab traffic

Figure 2.1: Monitoring enabled

Kali Linux initiated an Nmap scan against an Ubuntu machine to test Snortâ€™s reconnaissance detection.
The scan probed for open ports, services, and OS fingerprints, generating detectable network traffic.
Snort (if properly configured) should log alerts for scan patterns (e.g., SYN floods, service probes).
This simulation validates Snortâ€™s ability to detect basic Nmap scans as part of intrusion detection.

Snort successfully detected the scan and generated alerts.

Legion is another tool for information gathering. This tool was employed to simulate more advanced reconnaissance and network mapping attacks. Using Legion, the IP address of the Ubuntu machine was scoped, and detailed scans were performed.

The attack targeted different services running on the Ubuntu machine, attempting to map open ports and exploit known vulnerabilities.
